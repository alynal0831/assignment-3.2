            <p>Despite their long history and cultural significance, beards have also faced periods of stigma and
                discrimination. In some professional settings, beards have been viewed as unkempt or unprofessional,
                leading to policies that require men to be clean-shaven.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Allow your beard to grow without trimming for at least 4-6 weeks to see

                <li><strong>Keep It Clean:</strong> Wash your beard regularly with a gentle shampoo to keep it clean and
                    free of debris.</li>

                    dryness and itchiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Trim Regularly:</strong> Once your beard has grown out, trim it regularly to maintain its
                    shape and remove split ends.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat a Healthy Diet:</strong> A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can promote
                    healthy beard growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise can improve blood circulation, which can help with beard
                    growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Beard growth varies from person to person, so be patient and give it
                    time to grow.</li>
