                <div class="herding">
                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> were originally bred as <strong>herding dogs in Wales</strong>, where their unique short stature proved surprisingly advantageous. Their low-to-the-ground build allowed them to nip at the heels of cattle and duck beneath their powerful kicks. Despite their famously stubby legs, these dogs are remarkably <strong>fast</strong>, intensely <strong>smart</strong>, and absolutely brimming with <strong>energy</strong>! There are actually two distinct breeds: the <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> and the <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>. While both share the same spirited nature, the Pembroke is more popular and often recognized by its docked (or naturally bobbed) tail, whereas the Cardigan has a long, bushy tail.</p>

                    <p>There are two main types of the breed: the <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> and the <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>. While they share a common Welsh heritage and the breed’s characteristic short stature, they are considered entirely separate breeds, with the most immediate difference being the tail. The <strong>Pembroke</strong> usually has a naturally bobbed or <strong>docked tail</strong>, which was historically done to signify a working dog and avoid a tax on pet dogs. In contrast, the <strong>Cardigan’s tail is long and fox-like</strong>, a key distinguishing feature often carried low to the ground. Cardigans are also typically a bit larger and heavier, possessing a slightly more rounded ear shape, while the Pembroke's ears tend to be more pointed.</p>

                <div class="queen">    
                    <p><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> famously owned more than <strong>30 Pembroke Welsh Corgis</strong> throughout her life, creating an association that indelibly linked the charming, short-legged dogs to the British monarchy and helped make the breed world-famous. Her lifelong love affair with the breed began when she received her first Corgi, <strong>Susan</strong>, as an 18th birthday gift in 1944. All of the Queen's subsequent Corgis—and even her mixed-breed <strong>Dorgis</strong> (Corgi-Dachshund crosses)—were descended from this beloved matriarch. These royal companions were more than just pets; they were constant companions who often accompanied the Queen on her travels and even made humorous cameos, such as in the James Bond sketch for the <strong>2012 London Olympics</strong> opening ceremony.</p>

                <div class="sploot">    
                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> are widely known for their adorable and unique posture called the <strong>"sploot,"</strong> which is a canine resting position where they lie completely flat on their bellies with their rear legs stretched straight out behind them. This distinctive pose, sometimes referred to as a "frog-leg" position, is particularly common among short-legged breeds like Corgis because their low-slung, flexible bodies make it easy and comfortable. Owners often notice them "splooting" when they are relaxed or trying to cool down, as spreading their limbs maximizes the amount of body surface area that can make contact with a cool floor.</p>

                    <img src="https://placedog.net/400/400?id=9" alt="Cardigan Welsh Corgi">
                    <p>The two Corgi types, while both distinctly Welsh, maintain several differences, both physical and historical. The <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> is the more common type globally, largely due to its association with royalty. This breed is renowned for being particularly <strong>playful, affectionate, and fiercely loyal,</strong> often possessing a slightly more mischievous personality. Physically, it is known for its <strong>docked or naturally bobbed tail</strong> and its slightly fox-like head. The <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>, in contrast, is the older of the two breeds and has a slightly <strong>larger and heavier frame</strong>, with a more robust build and a deeper chest. The easiest way to spot a Cardigan is by its defining characteristic: <strong>a long, full, fox-like tail</strong> that acts as a natural rudder when they run and is carried low to the ground. Cardigans are generally considered a bit more mellow and steady than their Pembroke cousins.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Beards have a rich and varied history that spans across different cultures and eras. In ancient times,
                    beards were often seen as a symbol of wisdom, strength, and social status. For instance, in ancient
                    Egypt, pharaohs wore false beards as a sign of their divine authority. Similarly, in ancient Greece,
                    beards were associated with masculinity and knowledge, with philosophers like Socrates and Plato
                    famously sporting them.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Middle Ages, beards continued to hold cultural significance. Knights and noblemen often
                    grew beards as a sign of their bravery and honor. During the Renaissance, beards fell out of fashion in
                    Europe, but they made a comeback in the 19th century with the Victorian era, where full beards became a
                    symbol of the rugged, industrious man. Today, beards are a popular fashion statement and a form of
                    self-expression for many men around the world.</p>
                <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
                <p>Growing a beard requires patience and proper care. Here are some rules to follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Allow your beard to grow without trimming for at least 4-6 weeks to see
                        its full potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep It Clean:</strong> Wash your beard regularly with a gentle shampoo to keep it clean and
                        free of debris.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use beard oil or balm to keep your beard soft and hydrated, preventing
                        dryness and itchiness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trim Regularly:</strong> Once your beard has grown out, trim it regularly to maintain its
                        shape and remove split ends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eat a Healthy Diet:</strong> A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can promote
                        healthy beard growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise can improve blood circulation, which can help with beard
                        growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Beard growth varies from person to person, so be patient and give it
                        time to grow.</li>
                </ul>
