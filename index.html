                <h2>Fun Facts About Corgis</h2>
                <div class="herding">
                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> were originally bred as <strong>herding dogs in Wales</strong>, where their unique short stature proved surprisingly advantageous. Their low-to-the-ground build allowed them to nip at the heels of cattle and duck beneath their powerful kicks. Despite their famously stubby legs, these dogs are remarkably <strong>fast</strong>, intensely <strong>smart</strong>, and absolutely brimming with <strong>energy</strong>! There are actually two distinct breeds: the <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> and the <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>. While both share the same spirited nature, the Pembroke is more popular and often recognized by its docked (or naturally bobbed) tail, whereas the Cardigan has a long, bushy tail.</p>

                <div class="queen">    
                    <p><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> famously owned more than <strong>30 Pembroke Welsh Corgis</strong> throughout her life, creating an association that indelibly linked the charming, short-legged dogs to the British monarchy and helped make the breed world-famous. Her lifelong love affair with the breed began when she received her first Corgi, <strong>Susan</strong>, as an 18th birthday gift in 1944. All of the Queen's subsequent Corgis—and even her mixed-breed <strong>Dorgis</strong> (Corgi-Dachshund crosses)—were descended from this beloved matriarch. These royal companions were more than just pets; they were constant companions who often accompanied the Queen on her travels and even made humorous cameos, such as in the James Bond sketch for the <strong>2012 London Olympics</strong> opening ceremony.</p>

                <div class="sploot">    
                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> are widely known for their adorable and unique posture called the <strong>"sploot,"</strong> which is a canine resting position where they lie completely flat on their bellies with their rear legs stretched straight out behind them. This distinctive pose, sometimes referred to as a "frog-leg" position, is particularly common among short-legged breeds like Corgis because their low-slung, flexible bodies make it easy and comfortable. Owners often notice them "splooting" when they are relaxed or trying to cool down, as spreading their limbs maximizes the amount of body surface area that can make contact with a cool floor.</p>

                    <h2>The Corgi Personality</h2>
                    <p>Corgis are alert, affectionate, and intelligent dogs with big personalities in small bodies. They’re known for their friendliness and their love of attention. They also have a stubborn streak, which makes training both fun and challenging!</p>
                    <p>Because they were bred to herd, they’re energetic and love to stay busy — whether that’s chasing a ball or following their owner around the house.</p>
