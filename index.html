                <div class="herding">
                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> were originally bred as <strong>herding dogs in Wales</strong>, where their unique short stature proved surprisingly advantageous. Their low-to-the-ground build allowed them to nip at the heels of cattle and duck beneath their powerful kicks. Despite their famously stubby legs, these dogs are remarkably <strong>fast</strong>, intensely <strong>smart</strong>, and absolutely brimming with <strong>energy</strong>! There are actually two distinct breeds: the <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> and the <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>. While both share the same spirited nature, the Pembroke is more popular and often recognized by its docked (or naturally bobbed) tail, whereas the Cardigan has a long, bushy tail.</p>

                    <p>There are two main types of the breed: the <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> and the <strong>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</strong>. While they share a common Welsh heritage and the breed’s characteristic short stature, they are considered entirely separate breeds, with the most immediate difference being the tail. The <strong>Pembroke</strong> usually has a naturally bobbed or <strong>docked tail</strong>, which was historically done to signify a working dog and avoid a tax on pet dogs. In contrast, the <strong>Cardigan’s tail is long and fox-like</strong>, a key distinguishing feature often carried low to the ground. Cardigans are also typically a bit larger and heavier, possessing a slightly more rounded ear shape, while the Pembroke's ears tend to be more pointed.</p>

                <div class="queen">    
                    <p><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> famously owned more than <strong>30 Pembroke Welsh Corgis</strong> throughout her life, creating an association that indelibly linked the charming, short-legged dogs to the British monarchy and helped make the breed world-famous. Her lifelong love affair with the breed began when she received her first Corgi, <strong>Susan</strong>, as an 18th birthday gift in 1944. All of the Queen's subsequent Corgis—and even her mixed-breed <strong>Dorgis</strong> (Corgi-Dachshund crosses)—were descended from this beloved matriarch. These royal companions were more than just pets; they were constant companions who often accompanied the Queen on her travels and even made humorous cameos, such as in the James Bond sketch for the <strong>2012 London Olympics</strong> opening ceremony.</p>

                    <p><strong>Corgis</strong> are widely known for their adorable and unique posture called the <strong>"sploot,"</strong> which is a canine resting position where they lie completely flat on their bellies with their rear legs stretched straight out behind them. This distinctive pose, sometimes referred to as a "frog-leg" position, is particularly common among short-legged breeds like Corgis because their low-slung, flexible bodies make it easy and comfortable. Owners often notice them "splooting" when they are relaxed or trying to cool down, as spreading their limbs maximizes the amount of body surface area that can make contact with a cool floor.</p>

                    <h2>Different Breeds</h2>
                    <p>Corgis are charmingly cute, not just for their famously stubby legs and oversized, pointed ears, but also for their big-dog personality trapped in a small body. They are known for the adorable <strong>"sploot,"</strong> lying completely flat with their legs kicked out behind them, which is a hallmark of the breed's flexibility. This intelligent and affectionate breed often acts like a little shadow, following their beloved owners everywhere, and they are so food-motivated that training is a treat-filled breeze—though they will try to use their expressive eyes to negotiate for extra snacks!</p>

                    <p>Growing a beard requires patience and proper care. Here are some rules to follow:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Allow your beard to grow without trimming for at least 4-6 weeks to see
                            its full potential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep It Clean:</strong> Wash your beard regularly with a gentle shampoo to keep it clean and
                            free of debris.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use beard oil or balm to keep your beard soft and hydrated, preventing
                            dryness and itchiness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trim Regularly:</strong> Once your beard has grown out, trim it regularly to maintain its
                            shape and remove split ends.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eat a Healthy Diet:</strong> A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can promote
                            healthy beard growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise can improve blood circulation, which can help with beard
                            growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Beard growth varies from person to person, so be patient and give it
                            time to grow.</li>
                    </ul>
